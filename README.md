# PyData Toronto - August 16, 2017

## PyData Hands-On Data Science Night

We are excited to announce PyData Torontoâ€™s Hands-On Data Science Night!
We are partnering with [Sandbox by DMZ](http://sandboxdmz.ca) for an evening of
data science.
The goal of this meetup is to get participants started on solving data science
challenges.

Please RSVP only if you can show up as we have limited space!

We will walk you through extracting meaning from a data set using a wide
variety of machine learning and data science techniques with the Python
programming language.
If you are new to Python, don't worry, we will start with a quick overview of
Python and Jupyter Notebook
(the environment that we will use for completing this challenge).
If you have done some programming before, you should pick it up quickly.

The easiest way to get Jupyter Notebook
(as well as all packages used for this challenge) is to install the
[Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on your laptop.

Please bring your laptop (and charger) with Anaconda installed.
No experience in data science or programming necessary. We'll get you started!

Free Wi-Fi access will be provided.

Many thanks to our venue sponsor, [Sandbox by DMZ](http://sandboxdmz.ca) for
making this event possible!

## Data
